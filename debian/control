Description: A GPIO library for the Raspberry Pi by Gordon Henderson
 WiringPi is a GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835 used in the
 Raspberry Pi. It's released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and is usable from C
 and C++ and many other languages with suitable wrappers. There's also a
 command-line version. It's designed to be familiar to people who have used
 the Arduino "wiring" system. See http://wiringpi.com/
