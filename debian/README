The Debian Package for WiringPi
-------------------------------

Maintainer instructions:

- sudo apt-get install devscripts debhelper
- make package
- the .deb should now be in the directory package/version/...
- the Makefile includes code to use an Ubuntu PPA for distribution, but they
  don't currently support ARM so this is not useful... but according to
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-arm-n-public-panda-ppa-build-cluster
  there a build cluster is being constructed for ARM PPAs, so it would be good
  to check back there at some point
